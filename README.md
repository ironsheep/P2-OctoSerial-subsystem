# P2-OctoSerial-subsystem
A Parallax Propeller v2 Object for maintaining 1-8 simultaneous serial ports using one COG

## 8 Serial Ports using a single COG

A single COG services from 1 to 8 Tx/Rx pairs of pins.  The pins are configured as smart-pins which means that the driver feeds bytes to transmit pins when needed and get bytes from receive pins when bytes are available. This backend driver is written in pasm2. The interface routines are written in spin2.

A method is supplied that interprets newlines (0x0A) as line ends. (This allows the driver to work with LF or CRLF terminated lines.). This method when called frequently enough unloads the back-end circular buffers into string buffers, one for each active port. When a string has completely arrive it returns the complete strings.

### Driver Features

Key Features of this driver:

- Round robbin handling of active ports (not priority based)
- Only active ports are in round robbin
- 8 Active tx/rx port pairs Certified to 26x 115_200 -> 2\_995\_200 baud (w/clk at 300 MHz)
  - Hours of traffic run through all 8 ports P2 <-> P2 with no data corruption or loss at speed
  - All bytes of each message verified

### Current status

Latest Changes:

```
2023-01-19 Further testing results
- Tested with no failures at speeds (clock at 300MHz):
  - 115_200
  - 230_400 - 2x 115_200
  - 640_000
  - 2_000_000
  - 2_995_200 - 26x 115_200
  - Fails at 3_456_000 and above
2022-11-23 Draft release v1.0.0
- Services 1 to eight ports
- Tested initial configuration: 115,200 bps, N81
- Validated with serial decoding logic analyzer
- Tested Raspberry Pi <-> P2
- Tested P2 <-> P2
```

### Known Issues

We have more plans in the works:

- Characterize: Find and document at this repo the highest speeds the driver can do against various devices without data loss
- Add more discrete port control if users find a need (e.g., 2-stop bits, etc.)
