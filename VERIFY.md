## 8 Serial Ports using a single COG

A single COG services from 1 to 8 Tx/Rx pairs of pins.  The pins are configured as smart-pins which means that the driver feeds bytes to transmit pins when needed and get bytes from receive pins when bytes are available. This backend driver is written in pasm2. The interface routines are written in spin2.

## Measurement of Performance

When putting this driver through its paces, we clocked the p2 at 300 MHz and set the desired baud rate the same on both ends.  8 two-pin pairs are wired between the sending P2 and the receiving P2.  The sending end serial code is instrumented to send out port address, and tx/rx handler active statuses. I've also added a 3.3v to 5v level shifter to 1 port tx/rx pins so we can observe the serial traffic on this one port.  This allows us to get a sense of the timing of serial bits relative to the port scanning activity within the driver.

During this investication we found that at a clock of 300 Mhz the baud rate is limited to below 30 x 115,200 bps.  The maximum we successfully tested is 26 x 115,200 bps or 2,995,200 bits per second.

This is our test hardware setup:

We took measurements using this Logic Analyzer (LA) setup.  The following are screen captures with brief narrative for each set of captures.  The captures show the overall traffic alone with a transmit image and a receive image.
